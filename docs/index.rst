``es_client`` Documentation
===========================

You may wonder why this even exists, as at first glance it doesn't seem to make
anything any easier than just using :class:`elasticsearch.Elasticsearch` to
build a client connection.  I needed to be able to reuse the more complex
schema validation bits I was employing, namely:

* ``master_only`` detection
* AWS IAM credential collection via :class:`boto3.session.Session`
* Elasticsearch version checking and validation, and the option to skip this.
* Configuration value validation, including file paths for SSL certificates,
  meaning:

  * No unknown keys or unacceptable parameter values are accepted
  * Acceptable values and ranges are established--and easy to amend, if
    necessary.

So, if you don't need these, then this library probably isn't what you're
looking for.  If you want these features, then you've come to the right place.

Example Usage
-------------

::

    from es_client import Builder

    config = {
        'elasticsearch': {
            'master_only': True,
            'client': {
                'hosts': '10.0.0.123',
                'use_ssl': True,
                'ca_certs': '/etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca.crt',
                'username': 'joe_user',
                'password': 'password',
                'timeout': 60,
            }
        }
    }

    try:
        client = Builder(config).client
    except:
        # Do exception handling here...

Additionally, you can read from a YAML configuration file:

::

    ---
    elasticsearch:
      master_only: true
      client:
        hosts: 10.0.0.123
        use_ssl: true
        ca_certs: /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca.crt
        username: joe_user
        password: password
        timeout: 60

::

    from es_client import Builder
    from es_client.exceptions import ConfigurationError
    from es_client.helpers.utils import get_yaml

    try:
        client = Builder(get_yaml('/path/to/es_client.yml').client
    except:
        # Do exception handling here...

The same schema validations apply here as well.
