Changelog
=========

8.12.8 (20 March 2024)
----------------------

**Bugfix**

  * Really batting 1000 today. Missed a few places where the versions weren't bumped properly.

8.12.7 (20 March 2024)
----------------------

**Bugfix**

  * Erroneously removed ``six`` dependency. It's back at ``1.16.0``.

8.12.6 (20 March 2024)
----------------------

**Changes**

  * After reading and re-reading through the tutorial, I made a few doc changes.
  * ``ctx.obj`` is instantiated in ``helpers.config.context_settings`` now, saving yet another
    line of code from being needed in a functional command-line script.
  * Decided it was actually time to programmatically approach the huge list of decorators necessary
    to make ``es_client`` work in the example. Now there's a single decorator,
    ``@options_from_dict()`` in ``helpers.config``, and it takes a dictionary as an argument. The
    form of this dictionary should be:

    .. code-block:: python

      {
        "option1": {"onoff": {}, "override": {}, "settings": {}},
        "option2": {"onoff": {}, "override": {}, "settings": {}},
        # ...
        "optionN": {"onoff": {}, "override": {}, "settings": {}},
      }
    
    The defaults are provided in ``helpers.defaults`` as constants ``OPTION_DEFAULTS`` and
    ``SHOW_EVERYTHING``. These can be overridden programmatically or very tediously manually.
  * Dependency version bumps:

    .. code-block:: python

      elasticsearch8==8.12.1
      certifi==2024.2.2

8.12.5 (4 February 2024)
------------------------

**Changes**

After some usage, it seems wise to remove redundancy in calling params and config in the functions
in ``helpers.config``. This is especially true since ``ctx`` already has all of the params, and
``ctx.params['config']`` has the config file (if specified).

It necessitated a more irritating revamp of the tests to make it work (why, Click? Why can't a
Context be provided and just work?), but it does work cleanly now, with those clean looking
function calls.

New standards include:

  * ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SUPPORT.  Very big. Suffice to say that all command-line options can now
    be set by an environment variable by putting the prefix ``ESCLIENT_`` in front of the uppercase
    option name, and replace any hyphens with underscores. ``--http-compress True`` is settable by
    having ``ESCLIENT_HTTP_COMPRESS=1``. Boolean values are 1, 0, True, or False (case-insensitive).
    Options like ``hosts`` which can have multiple values just need to have whitespace between the
    values:

    .. code-block:: shell

       ESCLIENT_HOSTS='http://127.0.0.1:9200 http://localhost:9200'
    
    It splits perfectly. This is big news for the containerization/k8s community. You won't have to
    have all of the options spilled out any more. Just have the environment variables assigned.
  * ``ctx.obj['default_config']`` will be the place to insert a default configuration file
    _before_ calling ``helpers.config.get_config()``.
  * ``helpers.config.get_arg_objects()`` will now set ``ctx.obj['client_args'] = ClientArgs()``
    and ``ctx.obj['other_args'] = OtherArgs()``, where they become part of ``ctx.obj`` and are
    accessible thereby.
  * ``helpers.config.generate_configdict`` will now populate ``ctx.obj['configdict']``
  * ``Builder(configdict=ctx.obj['configdict'])`` will work, as will 
    ``helpers.config.get_client(configdict=ctx.obj['configdict'])``

In fact, this has been so simplified now that the flow of a command-line app is as simple as:

  .. code-block:: python

      def myapp(ctx, *args):
          ctx.obj = {}
          ctx.obj['default_config'] = '/path/to/cfg.yaml'
          get_config(ctx)
          configure_logging(ctx)
          generate_configdict(ctx)
          es_client = get_client(configdict=ctx.obj['configdict'])
          # Your other code...

Additionally, the log blacklist functionality has been added to the command-line, the default
settings, the ``helpers.logging`` module, and the ``cli_example``, which should be welcome news to
the containerized world.

Major work to standardize the documentation has also been undertaken. In fact, there is now a
tutorial on how to make a command-line app in the documentation.

8.12.4 (1 February 2024)
------------------------

**Fixes**

The try/except block for Docker logging needed to be out one level farther.

This should fix the permissions error issues at last.


8.12.3 (31 January 2024)
------------------------

**Change**

Since I'm doing Schema validation here now, I think it appropriate to have a
dedicated exception for SchemaCheck failures.

This will be FailedValidation.

8.12.2 (31 January 2024)
------------------------

**Fixes**

In trying to make ``SchemaCheck`` reusable, I discovered that it _always_,
was unconditionally attempting apply the ``password_filter`` on every
``config`` coming through. An empty filter shows up as ``None``, causing
an AttributeError exception. Going to only do ``password_filter`` when
``config`` is a ``dict``.

8.12.1 (31 January 2024)
------------------------

**Announcement**

**TL;DR â€”** I got sick of coding the same lines over and over again, and
copy/pasting between projects. I put that code here to make it easier to reuse.

You can now make CLI/Click-related functionality more portable for your apps
using ``es_client``.

There is not really any change to the base ``Builder`` class, nor the
``ClientArgs`` or ``OtherArgs`` classes, so this is more a function of support
tools and tooling for handling the overriding of config file options with those
supplied at a command-line.

The improvements are visible in ``cli_example.py``.

Some of these changes include:

  * Functions that simplify overriding configuration file options with ones
    from the command-line. Reduces dozens of lines of code to a single
    function call: ``get_args(ctx.params, config)``, which overrides the values
    from ``config`` with the command-line parameters from Click.
  * Re-usable ``cli_opts`` Click option wrapper function, complete with overrides.
    This is demonstrated with the hidden options vs. ``show-all-options`` in
    ``cli_example.py``.
  * Support basic logging configuration with ``default``, ``json``, and ``ecs``
  * New modules in ``es_client.helpers``:
      * ``config``
      * ``logging``
  * Lots and lots of tests, both unit and integration.
  * Updated all documentation for modules, functions, and classes accordingly.


8.12.0 (29 January 2024)
------------------------

**Changes**

  * Dependency version bumps in this release:
      * ``elasticsearch8==8.12.0``
      * ``voluptuous>=0.14.1``
      * ``certifi>=2023.11.17``
  
8.11.0 (15 November 2023)
-------------------------

**Changes**

  * Dependency version bumps in this version:
      * ``elasticsearch8==8.11.0``
  * Replace ``Mock`` with ``unittest.Mock`` in unit tests.
  * Add Python 3.12 as a supported version (tested).

8.10.3 (2 October 2023)
-----------------------

**Fixes**

Missed a few of the hidden options, and found a way to force the help output to
show for ``show-all-options`` without needing to add ``--help`` afterwards.

8.10.2 (2 October 2023)
-----------------------

**Announcement**

Again, no change in functionality. Changing some of the CLI options to be
hidden by default (but still usable). These options include:

  * ``bearer_auth``
  * ``opaque_id``
  * ``http_compress``
  * ``ssl_assert_hostname``
  * ``ssl_assert_fingerprint``
  * ``ssl_version``
  * ``master-only``
  * ``skip_version_test``

This will hopefully not surprise anyone too badly. I haven't heard of anyone
using these options yet. The CLI examle has been configured with a
``show-all-options`` command that will show all of the hidden options.

8.10.1 (29 September 2023)
--------------------------

**Announcement**

No change in functionality. Adding some ways to have CLI building via Click
easier for end users by making the basic arguments part of the ``es_client``
code. This is shown in the Example in the docs and in the code in 
file ``example_cli.py``.

8.10.0 (25 September 2023)
--------------------------

**Announcement**

The only changes in this release are dependency version bumps:

  * ``elasticsearch8==8.10.0``
  * ``click==8.1.7``

8.9.0 (31 July 2023)
--------------------

**Announcement**

The only changes in this release are dependency version bumps:

  * ``elasticsearch8==8.9.0``
  * ``click==8.1.6``
  * ``certifi==2023.7.22``

8.8.2.post1 (18 July 2023)
--------------------------

**Breakfix**

  * PyYAML 6.0.1 was released to address Cython 3 compile issues.

8.8.2 (12 July 2023)
--------------------

**Announcement**

Apologies for another delayed release. Weddings and funerals and graduations
have kept me from releasing anything in the interim.

**Changes**

  * Bring up to date with Elasticsearch 8.8.2 Python client
  * Other updated Python modules:
      * ``certifi>=2023.5.7``
      * ``click==8.1.4``

8.7.0 (12 April 2023)
---------------------

**Announcement**

Apologies for the delayed release. I have had some personal matters that had me
out of office for several weeks.

**Changes**

  * Bring up to date with Elasticsearch 8.7.0 Python client.
  * Add ``mock`` to the list of modules for testing

8.6.2.post1 (23 March 2023)
---------------------------

**Announcement**

  Late 8.6.2 post-release.

**Changes**

  * Fix certificate detection. See #33.
  * Add one-line API Key support (the Base64 encoded one).
  * Update docs to reflect base64 token API Key functionality.

8.6.2 (19 February 2023)
------------------------

**Announcement**

Version sync with released Elasticsearch Python module.

**Changes**

  * Fix ``cloud_id`` and ``hosts`` collision detection and add test to cover this case.
  * Code readability improvements (primarily for documentation).
  * Documentation readability improvements, and improved cross-linking.
  * Add example cli script to docs.

8.6.1.post1 (30 January 2023)
-----------------------------

**Announcement**

Even though I had a test in place for catching and fixing the absence of a port with ``https``,
it didn't work in the field. Fix included.

**Changes**

  * Fixed unverified URL schema issue.
  * Found and corrected another place where passwords were being logged inappropriately.

8.6.1 (30 January 2023)
-----------------------

**Announcement**

With all of these changes, I kept this in-house and did local builds and ``pip`` imports until
I worked it all out.

**Changes**

  * Circular imports between ``es_client.helpers.utils`` and ``es_client.helpers.schemacheck``
    broke things. Since ``password_filter`` is not presently being used by anything else,
    I moved it to ``schemacheck.py``.
  * Use ``hatch`` and ``hatchling`` for package building instead of ``flit``.
  * Update ``elasticsearch8`` dependency to ``8.6.1``
  * Removed the ``requirements.txt`` file as this is now handled by ``pyproject.toml`` and
    doing ``pip install .`` to grab dependencies and install them. YAY! Only one place to
    track dependencies now!!!
  * Removed the ``MANIFEST.in`` file as this is now handled by ``pyproject.toml`` as well.
  * Update the docs build settings to use Python 3.11 and ``elasticsearch8==8.6.1``

8.6.0.post6 (26 January 2023)
-----------------------------

**Announcement**

I'm just cranking these out today! The truth is, I'm catching more things with the increased
scrutiny of heavy Curator testing. This is good, right?

**Changes**

  * Discovered that passwords were being logged. Added a function to replace any value
    from a key (from ``KEYS_TO_REDACT`` in ``defaults.py``) with ``REDACTED``. Keys are
    ``['password', 'basic_auth', 'bearer_auth', 'api_key', 'id', 'opaque_id']``

8.6.0.post5 (26 January 2023)
-----------------------------

**Changes**

  * Python 3.11 was unofficially supported in 8.6.0.post4. It is now officially listed
    in ``pyproject.toml`` as a supported version.
  * Discovered that Builder was not validating Elasticsearch host URLs, and not catching
    those lead to an invisible failure in Curator.

8.6.0.post4 (26 January 2023)
-----------------------------

**Changes**

  * Fix an example in ``README.rst`` that showed the old and no longer viable way to
    get the client. New example reflects the current way.
  * Purge older setuptools files ``setup.py`` and ``setup.cfg`` in favor of building
    with ``flit``, using ``pyproject.toml``. Testing and dependencies here should install
    properly with ``pip install -U '.[test]'``. After this, testing works with ``pytest``,
    or ``pytest --cov=es_client --cov-report html:cov_html`` (``cov_html`` was added to
    ``.gitignore``). These changes appear to be necessary to build functional packages
    for Python 3.11.
  * Building now works with ``flit``. First ``pip install flit``, then ``flit build``.

8.6.0.post3 (19 January 2023)
-----------------------------

**Changes**

  * Improve ``helpers.utils`` function ``verify_url_schema`` ability to catch malformed
    URLs. Added tests to verify functionality.
  * Improve Docker test scripts. Now there's only one set of scripts in
    ``docker_test/scripts``. ``create.sh`` requires a semver version of Elasticsearch
    at the command-line, and it will build and launch a docker image based on that
    version. For example, ``./create.sh 8.6.0`` will create a test image. Likewise,
    ``destroy.sh`` will clean it up afterwards, and also remove the ``Dockerfile``
    which is created from the ``Dockerfile.tmpl`` template.


8.6.0.post2 (18 January 2023)
-----------------------------

**Changes**

  * Move the ``get_version`` method to its own function so other programs can also use it.
  * Pylint cleanup of most files

8.6.0.post1 (17 January 2023)
-----------------------------

**Changes**

  * Python prefers its own version to SemVer, so there are no changes but one of nomenclature.

8.6.0+build.2 (17 January 2023)
-------------------------------

**Changes**

  * Improve the client configuration parsing behavior. If absolutely no config is given, then set
    ``hosts`` to ``http://127.0.0.1:9200``, which mirrors the ``elasticsearch8`` client default
    behavior.

8.6.0 (11 Janary 2023)
----------------------

**Changes**

  * Version bump ``elasticsearch8==8.6.0``
  * Add Docker test environment for Elasticsearch 8.6.0

**Fixes**

  * Docker test environment for 8.5.3 was still running Elasticsearch version 8.4.3. This has been corrected.

8.5.0 (11 January 2023)
-----------------------

**Changes**

  * Version bump ``elasticsearch8==8.5.3``
  * Version bump ``certifi>=2022.12.7``
  * Add Docker test env for Elasticsearch 8.5.3

8.1.0 (3 November 2022)
-----------------------

**Breaking Changes**

Yeah. I know. It's not semver, but I don't care. This is a needed improvement, and I'm the only one
using this so far as I know, so it shouldn't affect anyone in a big way.

  * ``Builder`` now will not work unless you provide either a ``configdict`` or ``configfile``. It will
    read and verify a YAML ``configfile`` if provided without needing to do any other steps now.
  * ``Builder.client_args`` is not a dictionary any more, but a subclass with regular attributes.
    Yes, you can get and set attributes however you like now:

    .. code-block:: python

      b = Builder(configdict=mydict, autoconnect=False)
      print('Provided hosts = %s' % b.client_args.hosts)
      b.client_args.hosts = ['https://sub.domain.tld:3456']
      print('Updated hosts = %s' % b.client_args.hosts)
      b.connect()

    Yes, this will effectively change the entry for ``hosts`` and connect to it instead of whatever was provided.
    You can still get a full ``dict`` of the client args with ``Builder.client_args.asdict()``
  * ``Builder.other_args`` (reading in ``other_settings`` from the config) now works the same as
    ``Builder.client_args``. See the above for more info.

**Changes**

  * Add new classes ``ClientArgs`` and ``OtherArgs``. Using classes like these make setting defaults,
    updates, and changes super simple. Now everything is an attribute! And it's still super simple
    to get a ``dict`` of settings back using ``ClientArgs.asdict()`` or ``OtherArgs.asdict()``. This
    change makes it super simple to create this kind of object, override settings from a default or
    command-line options, and then export a ``configdict`` based on these objects to ``Builder``, as
    you can see in the new sample script ``cli_example.py`` for overriding a config file with
    command-line settings.
  * Added *sample* CLI override capacity using ``click``. This will make Curator and other projects
    easier. It's not even required, but a working example helps show the possibilities. You can
    run whatever you like with ``click``, or stick with config files, or whatever floats your boat.
  * The above change also means pulling in ``click`` as a dependency.
  * Moved some methods out of ``Builder`` to be functions in ``es_client.helpers.utils`` instead.
  * Updated tests to work with all of these changes, and added new ones for new functions.

8.0.5 (28 October 2022)
-----------------------

**Changes**

  * Version bumped `elasticsearch8` module to 8.4.3
  * Version bumped `certifi` module to 2022.9.24
  * Added Docker tests for Elasticsearch 8.4.3

8.0.4 (23 August 2022)
----------------------

**Changes**

  * Hopefully the last niggling detail. Removed erroneous reference to AWS ES
    and ``boto3`` compatibility from the description sent to PyPi.

8.0.3 (23 August 2022)
----------------------

**Changes**

  * Added ``setup_requires`` section to ``setup.cfg``. ``es_client`` doesn't
    _need_ to have ``setuptools`` to install.
  * Unpinned from top-level version of ``setuptools`` to allow anything
    greater than ``setuptools>=59.0.1`` to fit with Curator's need for
    ``cx_Freeze``, which can't currently use ``setuptools>60.10.0``

8.0.2 (23 August 2022)
----------------------

**Changes**

  * Several more doc fixes to make things work on ReadTheDocs.io

8.0.1 (23 August 2022)
----------------------

**Changes**

  * Update test platform from ancient ``nose`` and ``UnitTest`` framework to use
    ``pytest``. This also allows the client to run on Python 3.10.
  * Update ``README.rst`` so both GitHub and PyPi reflects what's in the documentation.

8.0.0 (22 August 2022)
----------------------

**New Features**

  * Use ``elasticsearch8==8.3.3`` library with this release.
  * Updated all APIs to reflect updated library usage patterns as many APIs
    have changed.
  * Native support for API keys
  * Native support for Cloud ID URL types
  * Updated tests for better coverage
  * Removed all AWS authentication as the ``elasticsearch8`` library no longer
    connects to AWS ES instances.


1.1.1 (19 April 2018)
---------------------

**Changes**

  * Disregard root-level keys other than ``elasticsearch`` in the supplied
    configuration dictionary.  This makes it much easier to pass in a complete
    configuration and only extract the `elasticsearch` part.
  * Validate that a dictionary was passed, as opposed to other types.

1.1.0 (19 April 2018)
---------------------

**New Features**

  * Add YAML configuration file reading capability so that part is included
    here, rather than having to be bolted on by the user later on.

**Changes**

  * Moved some of the utility functions to the ``Builder`` class as they were
    not needed outside the class.  While this would be a semver breaking
    change, the library is young enough that I think it will be okay, and it
    doesn't break anything else.
  * Put the default Elasticsearch version min and max values in ``default.py``

1.0.1 (12 April 2018)
---------------------

**Bug Fixes**

* It was late, and I forgot to update ``MANIFEST.in`` to include subdirectories
  of ``es_client``.  This has been addressed in this release.

1.0.0 (11 April 2018)
---------------------

**Initial Release**
